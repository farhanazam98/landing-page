# landing-page

This project is part of the Odin Project Curriculum. I am using it to ramp-up on front-end end technologies. I started with a screenshot of what the final page should look like, along with some values for styling (fonts, colors, etc.) and built the entire page from scratch using HTML and CSS. You can read more about the project <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page" here> here</a>.
